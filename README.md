# HateSpeechRegressor
A simple MLP regressor trained with sklearn.

Uses UCBerkley's [hate speech dataset](https://huggingface.co/datasets/ucberkeley-dlab/measuring-hate-speech)

If you want to use the model, either download model.pkl, vectorizer.pkl, and testing.py, or train one yourself with the training code. Remember to credit me and UCBerkeley as per the license terms.

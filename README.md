# HateSpeechRegressor
A simple MLP regressor trained with sklearn.

Uses UCBerkley's [hate speech dataset](https://huggingface.co/datasets/ucberkeley-dlab/measuring-hate-speech)

If you want to use the model, either download model.pkl, vectorizer.pkl, and testing.py, or train one yourself with the training code. Remember to credit me and UCBerkley

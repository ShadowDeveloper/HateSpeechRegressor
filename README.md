# HateSpeechRegressor
WARNING: THE EXAMPLES PROVIDED IN THE TEST AND TRAIN FILES CONTAIN EXTREME PROFANITY AND OFFENSIVE LANGUAGE.

A simple MLP regressor trained with sklearn.

Uses UCBerkley's [hate speech dataset](https://huggingface.co/datasets/ucberkeley-dlab/measuring-hate-speech)

If you want to use the model, run `pip install -r requirements.txt`. Then, run `train.py`. It will take 4-8 hours. Remember to credit me and UCBerkeley as per the license terms.

## Challenge!
If you would like a challenge, try downloading [this](https://www.mediafire.com/file/4hmr5yvuhbzvv25/challenge.zip/file)!
Try to max out your score for the most hateful insult, or try to win people over with great compliments. (By using these files you acknowledge that I am not liable for any mess you cause)
`challenge.py` is a simple console-based program, but if you want an (admitably ugly) GUI, use `challengeGUI.py`
